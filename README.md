# Devlog Entry - [11/21/2025]
## How we satisfied the software requirements
The third party rendering library we used is Groverburder’s 3D (g3d) engine. This rendering library is compatible with LOVE2D allowing us to implement 3d assets along with the physics mechanics. Our game fulfills the F1 requirements, as a puzzle game build on a platform that originally doesn’t support 3D rendering/physics simulation but with the help of Groverburger’s 3D engine we implemented 3D assets and physics mechanics. The puzzle involves the player having to push a box over the red death zone so the player can have a platform to jump over the death zone. 

## Reflection
We continued using Love2d. Are tools expanded compared to the original plan. We initially stated at visual studio code and Pixilart as our only tools but we expanded to use Groverburger’s 3D (g3d) for use of 3D features in LOVE2D.  Our team roles also changed as we recognized that some members have more programming experience. We switched roles to better enhance the workflow of the project and allow teammates with more knowledge an opportunity to take on leadership roles. 

## Introducing the team
### Anson Fong - Testing Lead
### Daisy Fragoso - Tools Lead backup
### Darren Fang - Engine Lead
### Diego Tiscareno - Tools Lead
### Mandy Lau - Design Lead

## Tools and materials
### Engine
The engine we plan on using is [love2d](https://love2d.org/). We chose this engine because we want to learn tools that are more familiar to game developers. If this doesn't go well we might make the switch to [Phaser](https://phaser.io/). Phaser is a good alternative for us because we learned Phaser in CMPM 120 and feel that we have a decent understanding of it. We could refer back to old work if we run into issues or want to take something from previous assignments. 
### Language
The language we intend to use for this project will be [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). The data language we will be using is [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). We decided to use these languages because we have experience in these languages and feel comfortable using them. Previous classes required the use of JavaScript for our games like in CMPM 120 as well as utilizing JSON files. With a lot of the games we've made being in JavaScript, we will be able to reuse more code and save a lot of time.
### Tools
The IDE we plan on using will be [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and for art assets, [Pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/draw). Visual Studio Code is something we have all used in the past and are fairly familiar with it. It is also very popular so if we ever run into issues, there are many ways we can get help. We decided to use a pixel art website because creating pixel art is fairly simple and doesn't take too much time. We want to focus more on different aspects such as the coding instead of art assets. Having pixel art makes the process of creating art faster.
### Generative AI
We intend on using [Brace](https://bayleaf.chat/?model=brace-85291) and other models such as [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). We might use these programs for generating ideas for our game as well as troubleshooting bugs. We won't allow for generative AI to change all of our code completely, but we might use some of its suggestions in our code. We will also be using language models to generate test cases. In addition to human playtests, AI models can provide tests for us to catch any potential bugs.

## Outlook
With the tools and materials we are using, we hope to learn the creative process of making a game as well as learning how to make a game without too many constraints. We also hope to learn how to use tools outside of what is required in courses. The riskiest part of this project might be experimenting with new engines. We plan on using tools more familiar to game developers so we are leaning more towards using [love2d](https://love2d.org/). Creating games with a new engine might be difficult and our hardest challenge.
