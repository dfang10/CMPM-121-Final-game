# Devlog Entry - [11/14/2025]

## Introducing the team
### Anson Fong - Tesing Lead
### Darren Fang - Engine Lead
### Diego Tiscareno - Tools Lead
### Mandy Lau - Design Lead

## Tools and materials
### Engine - 
### Language - The language we intend to use for this project will be [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The data language we will be using is [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). We decided to use these languages because we have experience in these languages and feel comfortable using them. Previous classes required the use of JavaScript for our games like in CMPM 120 as well as utilizing JSON files. With a lot of the games we've made being in JavaScript, we will be able to reuse more code and save a lot of time.
### Tools - The IDE we plan on using will be [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and for art assets, [Pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/draw). Visual Studio Code is something we have all used in the past and are fairly familiar with it. It is also very popular so if we ever run into issues, there are many ways we can get help. We decided to use a pixel art website because creating pixel art is fairly simple and doesn't take too much time. We want to focus more on different aspects such as the coding instead of art assets. Having pixel art makes the process of creating art faster.
### Generative AI - We intend on using [Brace](https://bayleaf.chat/?model=brace-85291) and other models such as [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). We might use these programs for generating ideas for our game as well as troubleshooting bugs. We won't allow for generative AI to change all of our code completely, but we might use some of its suggestions in our code. We will also be using language models to generate test cases. In addition to human playtests, AI models can provide tests for us to catch any potential bugs.
